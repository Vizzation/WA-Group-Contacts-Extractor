# WA Group Contacts Extractor

This simple Chrome extension extracts contact information from WhatsApp group chats on WhatsApp Web. It exports the contacts into a CSV file.  
The icons used are simple placeholders and can be replaced easily.
This extension should work with any Chromium-based browser.
The process will be similar on any Chromium browser but I am only highlighting Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge as I use them daily.

Open [Edge Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/wa-group-contacts-extract/pkopoomjfajbmibjjdcjgmolkikhcfcj) and click "Get" button to install the extension.

## How to Use
1. If you are using Microsoft Edge, Open `edge://extensions/`
   or  
   if you are using Google Chrome, Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking on the toggle.
3. Click on the 'Load Unpacked' button and navigate to the folder where you have downloaded this repo.

7. Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
8. Click "Extract Contacts" to download a CSV file containing the names and numbers of the group members.
