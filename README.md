# WA Group Contacts Extractor

This is a simple Chrome extension that extracts contact information from WhatsApp group chats on WhatsApp Web. It exports the contacts into a CSV file.  
Icons used are a simple placeholder and can be replaced easily.
This extension should work with any chromium based browser.
The process will be similiar on any chromium browser but I am only highlighting Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge as I use them on daily basis.

## How to Use
1. If you are using Microsoft Edge, Open `edge://extensions/`
   or  
   if you are using Google Chrome, Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking on the toggle.
3. Click on the 'Load Unpacked' button and navigate to the folder where you have downloaded this repo.
4. Select the folder and you're done.
5. Open [WhatsApp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com) and log in.
6. Open a group chat from which you want to extract contacts.
7. Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
8. Click "Extract Contacts" to download a CSV file containing the names and numbers of the group members.
